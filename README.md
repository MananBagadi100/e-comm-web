# E-comm Web

This is a simple full-stack **E-commerce website** project.

- **Frontend:** React + Vite (`my-react-app/`)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + MySQL (`backend/`)

## Features (Work in Progress)
- Product listing and filters  
- Cart functionality  
- Basic authentication (with bcrypt)  
- REST APIs  

This project is mainly for **learning and portfolio building**, not production-ready.

cd backend
npm install
# configure backend/.env (DB credentials, PORT=3000)
npm start
